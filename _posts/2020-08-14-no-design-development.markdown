There has been a situation in every developer's life where he/she feels like **`I am not good at designing`** when a task of developing a nice-looking (if not the best-looking) user interface for a website.

Whether you are a Backend dev or a Full-Stack dev (lets omit a Front-end dev for their sake , lol), things will be fine until you create backend services/api's for an application. But the real difficulty comes when there is no seperate team to handle UI part of it, or lets say it might be your personal side project. You might have to get your hands dirty and let that **`creative you`** come out to represent the data in a proper way (or appealing way) in UI. After some time (may be more time), playing around with some html and css, you might end up giving up on yourself and self-declaring that I am not at all good at UI designing. 

Well, if you have faced this kind of situation ever before, its perfectly alright and this article might help you in finding yourself a way into boost our confidence in designing UI. 

Let me introduce some of my curated list of free and open-source resources that will definetely help you.
